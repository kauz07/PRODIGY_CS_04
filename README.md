# 🕵️‍♂️ Keylogger - Record Your Keyboard Adventures! 🎹

Welcome to the Keylogger project! This simple yet intriguing tool allows you to record and log keystrokes on your computer. Disclaimer: Always use responsibly and with consent! 🔒

## How it Works 🛠️

The Keylogger program runs silently in the background, capturing every keystroke you make. It then logs these keystrokes to a file, providing you with a comprehensive record of your keyboard adventures! 📝

## Getting Started 🚀

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Python installed.
3. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install pynput`.
4. Run the `keylogger.py` file.
5. Start typing! Your keystrokes will be logged to a file named `keylog.txt`.

## Features 🌟

- Records all keystrokes in real-time.
- Logs the keystrokes to a file for future reference.
- Simple and lightweight, running in the background without disturbing your work.

## Ethical Considerations 🛡️

Remember, with great power comes great responsibility! Always ensure you have explicit consent before using this tool. Unauthorized use of keyloggers is illegal and unethical.

## Example Usage 🎉
